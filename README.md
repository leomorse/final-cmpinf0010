This repository is for the final project of Pitt's CMPINF0010 class. It's dedicated to finding the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh to be a stray cat, based on the amount of air pollution (less=better), the amount of trees (cats like to climb trees; they provide shelter) and the amount of trashcans (for scavenging, and because trash attracts mice/rats).

[[Air pollution data]](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/toxic-release-inventory/resource/2750b8c8-246b-430f-b1e0-1aa96e00b013)

[[Smart Trash Containers Data Set]](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/smart-trash-containers)
This data set gives the location of every city-maintained smart trash container.
